1-If the container “lives” in memory (array, collection, etc) then IEnumerable will be used. Otherwise (if it is outside of memory), IQueryable will be used.

2-IEnumerable can do forward-only reading in memory, but IQueryable can do the forward-backward reading.


3-Querying as IEnumerable will lead to retrieving all the data to the memory. This means if you want to do some filtering, sorting, etc., 
it will be done in memory rather than in the source of the information. IQueryable doesn’t read all the information to the memory. 
First, it collects all the queries and executes them as a single query to the container. For additional queries (sorting, filtering, etc.) through the IQueryable interface,
.NET will “generate” query to the source, and all the operations will be done directly in the source.
